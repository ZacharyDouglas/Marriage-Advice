# Marriage-Advice

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my use of the Composite and Visitor patterns.

We create a genealogical tree and allow the user to input 2 names.  The program checks that each candidate doesn't violate one of the following rules:

1.  It is illegal to marry oneself.
2.  It is illegal to marry your parents.
3.  It is illegal to marry your children.
4.  It is illegal to marry your Aunt/Uncles.
5.  It is illegal to marry your cousins.
6.  It is illegal to marry if one of the candidates is already married.
